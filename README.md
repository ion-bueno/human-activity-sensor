# Implementation of a system for human activity detection using smartphone sensor data

The objective is to implement a system for human activity detection using monitorized data by means of smartphone sensors. First, we have to preprocess the signals applying recommended techniques from the paper *Activity Recognition Using Inertial Sensing for Healthcare, Wellbeing and Sports Applications: A Survey* (**original_work.pdf**). Then, using machine learning algorithms with hyper-parameter tuning, we make the predictions.

## Data

The data is composed by sequences of sensor data corresponding to different persons performing a set of activities in seminaturalistic conditions. It corresponds with **AR_database.mat**.
